          <p>Software engineer. Occasionally a teacher. Permanently curious.</p>
          <p>
            I build things that work, then make them easier to understand.<br />
            Mostly JavaScript. Often full-stack. Always learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently interested in clean interfaces, thoughtful systems, and
            software that doesn’t shout at the user.

          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            I didn’t take the straight line into software, which turns out to be
            useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve shipped production code in a large engineering organisation,
            taught computer science to humans who absolutely did not ask for it,
            and spent a lot of time learning how systems actually behave once
            they leave the whiteboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            I care about clarity, maintainability, and making sensible
            trade-offs. I’m not allergic to complexity, I just don’t invite it
            round unless it has a good reason to be there.

              Worked in a cross-functional team on a large, production React and
              Node.js codebase.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Built and maintained features across the full stack,
                collaborating closely with product and design.
              </li>
              <li>
                Contributed through code reviews, testing, and sensible
                incremental improvements (the boring stuff that makes software
                survive).
              </li>
              <li>
                Got very familiar with real-world constraints: performance,
                reliability, and shipping without breaking everything.

              Taught programming and systems thinking, and learned fast that
              explaining something clearly is a stricter test than implementing
              it.

                Planned and delivered lessons on HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Python,

              <li>
                Built structured resources and coursework support aligned to

              <li>
                Improved my communication and debugging under pressure, because
