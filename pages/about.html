  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>
    I didn’t take the straight line into software, which turns out to be useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve shipped production code in a large engineering organisation, taught
    computer science to humans who absolutely did not ask for it, and spent a
    lot of time learning how systems actually behave once they leave the
    whiteboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    I care about clarity, maintainability, and making sensible trade-offs. I’m
    not allergic to complexity, I just don’t invite it round unless it has a
    good reason to be there.

    <header class="role-header">
      <h4>Graduate Software Engineer</h4>
      <p class="role-meta">Flutter UK &amp; Ireland</p>
    </header>
    <p>
      Worked in a cross-functional team on a large, production React and Node.js
      codebase.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Built and maintained features across the full stack, collaborating
        closely with product and design.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contributed through code reviews, testing, and sensible incremental
        improvements (the boring stuff that makes software survive).
      </li>
      <li>
        Got very familiar with real-world constraints: performance, reliability,
        and shipping without breaking everything.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <h4>Computer Science Teacher (Supply / Long-Term)</h4>
      <p class="role-meta">A-Level &amp; T-Level Software Development</p>
    </header>
    <p>
      Taught programming and systems thinking, and learned fast that explaining
      something clearly is a stricter test than implementing it.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Planned and delivered lessons on HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Python,
        adjusting pace and scaffolding for mixed confidence levels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Built structured resources and coursework support aligned to
        specification requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved my communication and debugging under pressure, because a
        classroom is basically a live incident response exercise.
